    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Difference between loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - `loc` is like using labels (column names or row indexes) to access data, while `iloc` is like using integer positions. For example, `df.loc[1]` would access the row labeled '1', whereas `df.iloc[1]` would access the second row (position 1) in the DataFrame.\n",

    "Q3. **Reindexing and Accessing Rows in new_df:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   new_df = df.reindex([3, 0, 1, 2])  # Reindex the DataFrame.\n",

    "Q5. **Replacing Data in 'column_2' and Calculating Mean:**\n",
    "   - If you replace data in 'column_2' with a string, you'll likely get errors when calculating the mean because you can't calculate the mean of a string. The mean function typically works with numeric data.\n",
