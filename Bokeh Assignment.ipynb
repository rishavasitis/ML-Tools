    "Q1. **Creating a Bokeh Plot with Python:**\n",
    "   - You can create a Bokeh plot using Python by following these steps:\n",
    "     1. Import the necessary Bokeh modules.\n",
    "     2. Prepare your data, typically in the form of Python lists or Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "     3. Create a figure to serve as the canvas for your plot.\n",
    "     4. Add various glyphs (shapes or markers) to represent your data on the plot.\n",
    "     5. Customize the appearance of the plot, such as axes, title, and legend.\n",
    "     6. Show or save the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Glyphs in Bokeh: Adding Shapes to a Plot:**\n",
    "   - Glyphs in Bokeh are visual markers, like circles, squares, lines, or bars, that represent data points.\n",
    "    To add them to a Bokeh plot, you can use the `circle()`, `square()`, `line()`, or other glyph functions. \n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "   p = figure()\n",
    "   p.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  # Adds circles to the plot at specific coordinates.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Customizing Appearance in Bokeh:**\n",
    "   - To customize a Bokeh plot's appearance, you can use various methods like `title`, `xaxis`, and `yaxis`. For instance:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "   p = figure(title=\"Customized Plot\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis Label\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis Label\")\n",
    "   p.title.text_font_size = \"16pt\"  # Change title font size.\n",
    "   p.xaxis.major_label_text_font_size = \"12pt\"  # Change X-axis label font size.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Bokeh Server for Real-Time Interactive Plots:**\n",
    "   - A Bokeh server allows you to create interactive plots that can be updated in real-time. \n",
    "    You define a Bokeh application that handles user interactions.\n",
    "    When you run the server, it serves the interactive plot. \n",
    "    For example, you can create a real-time stock price dashboard that updates as new data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Embedding Bokeh in Web Pages with Flask or Django:**\n",
    "   - You can embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using frameworks like Flask or Django by generating HTML components.\n",
    "    Bokeh provides a function called `components` that returns the HTML and JavaScript needed to render the plot.\n",
    "    You can insert these components into your web template, and your Bokeh plot will be displayed within your web application.\n",
    "    This allows you to seamlessly integrate Bokeh visualizations into your web-based projects."
